### Create a new user in ServiceNow for Grafana to connect with

**_The new user's Time zone MUST be set to "GMT" and they need the role of "admin"._**

## Step 2: Install Grafana Plugin

### Quick Install:

Option based scripts written for each operating system give you the option to install Grafana + our plugin or just our plugin in your existing Grafana. [Click here for Quick Install Setup](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/tree/main/scripts)

### Manual Install:

Download or clone the repository and move the unziped folder into your Grafana plugins folder, then restart Grafana.

## Step 3: Grafana Datasource Configuration

1. Open Grafana Configuration => Data Sources
2. Click on the "Add data source" Button
3. Search for and add our "servicenow-optimiz-plugin"
4. Configure the data source based on fields below. Required fields are marked with a ‚ùó

- API Path: Path to our application's API's in your ServiceNow instance. (Please do not change the default value unless you are a developer or understand the implications)
- Cache Timeout: Choose length of time to cache each query
- ‚ùó URL: The URL to your ServiceNow instance. (For convenience the default value is mostly filled in. Just replace <instance_name> with your own)
- ‚ùó Access: Leave this value as Server (default)

- ‚ùó With Credentials: Set this to true
- ‚ùó User: Enter the ServiceNow username we created earlier in Step 1
